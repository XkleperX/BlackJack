Functions

    calculate_score(choice):
        Input: A list of integers representing the player's or computer's hand.
        Output: The total score of the hand, considering the value of Ace as 1 or 11 to optimize the score.

Main Code Logic

    Initialization:
        Two hands (your_choice and computer_choice) are initialized with two random cards each.
        The initial scores for both hands (your_score and computer_score) are calculated using the calculate_score() function.

    Player's Turn:
        The player is prompted to decide whether to "hit" (draw another card) or "stand" (keep their current hand).
        If the player chooses to hit, a random card is drawn from the deck and added to the player's hand.
        The player's score is recalculated after each card draw, and if the score exceeds 21, the player busts.

    Computer's Turn:
        After the player stands, the computer dealer automatically draws cards until its score is at least 17.

    Determining the Winner:
        Once both hands are finalized, the winner is determined based on the total scores.
        If the player busts or the computer's score exceeds 21, the player wins.
        If the player's score is higher than the computer's score (without busting), the player wins.
        If the computer's score is higher than the player's score (without busting), the computer wins.
        If both scores are equal, it's a tie.

Limitations

    The code does not include user input validation or error handling for invalid inputs.
    It doesn't implement the full gameplay loop and interaction between the player and the computer dealer.
